   <section id="community-guidelines" aria-labelledby="guidelines-heading">
  <h2 id="guidelines-heading">10. Community Guidelines</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the DevTemple community a hub built for creators, coders, and curious minds. To keep our platform inspiring, respectful, and safe for everyone, please follow these guidelines carefully:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Be a Good Human:</strong> Treat others with respect. No harassment, hate speech, threats, or discrimination of any kind. Everyone deserves to code in peace.</li>
    
    <li><strong>No Shady Code or Fraud:</strong> Only upload your own or properly licensed work. Selling someone else’s code, spreading malware, or scamming users will result in immediate suspension and permanent ban. Fraud attempts may also be reported to authorities.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Keep It Honest:</strong> Be transparent about what you’re offering. Misleading descriptions, false claims, or fake “premium” files damage trust. Represent your projects truthfully honesty builds your reputation.</li>
    
    <li><strong>No Review Rigging:</strong> Don’t manipulate ratings, reviews, or feedback. Let your work speak for itself; fake engagement or self-promotion under multiple accounts isn’t tolerated.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Stay Secure:</strong> Never share private credentials, API keys, or sensitive data. If you discover a security issue, report it responsibly to <a href="mailto:safety@devtem.org">safety@devtem.org</a>.</li>
    
    <li><strong>No Harmful or Illegal Content:</strong> Don’t upload or promote anything involving violence, drugs, hacking tools, sexual content, or anything illegal. Keep DevTemple professional, creative, and safe for all audiences.</li>
    
    <li><strong>One Account = One Creator:</strong> Each account should belong to a single individual or verified team. Avoid creating duplicates or impersonating others that’s a one-way trip to suspension.</li>
    
    <li><strong>No Unapproved Ads or Promotions:</strong> Want to promote something? Get written approval first. Unsolicited ads, spam messages, or referral links will be removed immediately.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Respect Intellectual Property:</strong> Credit other developers when due. Don’t use copyrighted materials without permission — open source is great, but stealing code isn’t.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Keep It Professional:</strong> Maintain a constructive tone when giving feedback. Helpful criticism improves the community; toxic comments break it.</li>
    
    <li><strong>No Payment Scams or Refund Abuse:</strong> Payments, withdrawals, or refunds must follow DevTemple’s verified processes. Attempting to bypass or manipulate transactions will result in permanent account termination.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Contribute Positively:</strong> Help others grow! Share knowledge, report bugs, and inspire innovation. DevTemple thrives when we build together.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Violating these rules may lead to warnings, content removal, account restrictions, suspension, or permanent bans depending on severity. Serious cases involving fraud or legal breaches will be escalated to the appropriate authorities.</p>
  
  <p>Let’s keep DevTemple a creative, honest, and empowering place where developers build, share, and earn with integrity. 🚀</p>

  <h2 id="payment-refunds-heading">12. Payment & Refunds Policy</h2>
  
  <h3>How Payments Work</h3>
  <p>All transactions on DevTemple are processed securely through <strong>Paystack</strong>.
    Buyers must ensure they provide accurate details and follow on-screen instructions during checkout.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Do Not Close Checkout:</strong> When redirected to Paystack or other payment processors, do not close your browser or window until payment is fully processed. Closing the window early may result in no purchase being recorded, and it can be very difficult to trace or refund such incomplete transactions.</li>
    <li>After a successful payment, you will be redirected back to DevTemple where your purchase will be confirmed and available for you.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Buyer Responsibilities</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Report harmful or malicious content immediately, we have provided reports button on all listed posts. Or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:office@devtem.org">office@devtem.org</a>.</li>
    <li>Ensure you review the product description, cover image, and preview materials before purchase. All sales are considered final unless covered by specific refund exceptions.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Refunds</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Payments are generally <strong>non-refundable</strong> unless there are clear technical issues preventing access to purchased content.</li>
    <li>If the issue is due to Paystack (e.g., failed debit, double charge), Paystack will handle the refund process in line with their refund policies. Refund timelines may vary according to their terms.</li>
    <li>DevTemple may approve refunds at its discretion if:
      <ul>
        <li>The buyer did not receive access to the purchased item due to a verified system error.</li>
        <li>The purchased content was proven to be fraudulent, harmful, or misrepresented.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Seller Pricing Rules</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>All product prices must reflect fair value and align with the intended use of the content.</li>
    <li>Excessively inflated or misleading prices may result in content removal or account penalties.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Post Presentation Standards</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Each listing must include a clear and accurate <strong>cover image</strong> representing the product’s purpose.</li>
    <li>Screenshots, images, or preview videos must reflect the <strong>actual frontend or output</strong> of the product as users will experience it.</li>
    <li>Misleading visuals or stock images unrelated to the actual product are strictly prohibited.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Creator Payouts & Payment Issues</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Creators receive payouts for their sales according to DevTemple’s commission structure.</li>
    <li>Payouts are processed securely through Paystack or other supported methods.</li>
    <li>If a payout is delayed or disputed, creators must contact DevTemple support within 30 days to resolve the issue.</li>
    <li>DevTemple reserves the right to withhold payouts if the related sales are under investigation for fraud, policy violations, or refund disputes.</li>
  </ul>
